<h1>  About Me </h1>
  <body> 
 My name is Camraneke Harden. I attend The Noble Academy, and I am headed into my junior year of high school. 
 I am a dedicated sprinter and captain of my track team. I am the type of person that is very dedicated to my work. 
 I also love to help others acheive their goals. Some of the things I like are sports, math, and tutoring. </body>
    <h2> Fun Facts </h2> 
 <body>  Fun Fact about me is that I want to attend Princeton University, and I hate Reading. I love Princeton because this school gave me the quote " it's not who's going to let you; It's who's going to stop you" by Ayn Rand
