     <h1> Fun Facts </h1>
 <div style="width:500px;height:100px;border:1px solid #000;">A Fun Fact about me is that I want to attend Princeton University, and I hate Reading. I love Princeton because this school gave me the quote " It's not who's going to let you; It's who's going to stop you," Ayn Rand
 I live by this quote, and it makes me push myself out of my comfort zone. It also helps me push through difficult times.</div>

     <h1> My Favorite Websites </h1>
  <div style="width:500px;height:150px;border:1px solid #000;">One of my favorite websites is Khan Academy "https://www.khanacademy.org" because it has many different things that a student can learn. Also, I like that it isn't based on one topic. It is like a large learning center, and you can learn many academic things.
Another one of my favorite websites is "powerschool.noblenetwork.org" because it helps me keep up with my grades and progresss of how I am doing in school.</div>
