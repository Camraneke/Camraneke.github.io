<h1>  About Me </h1>
  <body> 
 My name is Camraneke Harden. I attend The Noble Academy, and I am headed into my junior year of high school. 
 I am a dedicated sprinter and captain of my track team. I am the type of person that is very dedicated to my work. 
 I also love to help others acheive their goals. Some of the things I like are sports, math, and tutoring. </body>
    <h2> Fun Facts </h2> 
 <body> A Fun Fact about me is that I want to attend Princeton University, and I hate Reading. I love Princeton because this school gave me the quote " it's not who's going to let you; It's who's going to stop you" by Ayn Rand
 I live by this quote, and it makes me push myself out of my comfort zone. It also helps me push through difficult times.  </body>   
  
  One of my favorite websites is Khan Academy "https://www.khanacademy.org" because it has many different things that a student can learn. Also, I like that it isn't based on one topic. It is like a large learning center, and you can learn many academic things.
